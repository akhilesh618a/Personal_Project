😺 I'm happy to share this **fun and interactive project** I built using **Python's Turtle Graphics**!

I've always enjoyed blending **creativity with code**, and this little **cartoon cat project** was my way of doing just that. The cat is not only cute — it’s **interactive, animated, and responsive** to you!
